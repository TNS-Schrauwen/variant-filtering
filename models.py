# This file is for functions that apply the filters to the families based on
# the different inheritance models (ar, xl, xldn, ch, addn, ad)
# where:
# ar: autosomal recessive
# xl: x-linked
# xldn: x-linked de novo
# ch: compount heterozygous
# addn: autosomal dominant de novo
# ad: autosomal dominant

# The functions should take in the variant data frame and a Family object,
# and output a data frame of possible variants.
